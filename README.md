# VisualHeat
This application allows the end user to visualize average global temperature variations. This presents the data in sets of every 20 years.

## Motivation

The objective of the project is to utilize plotting data to present a visualization of the change in temperature over a period of time. Global temperature changes are a hot topic these days and some find themselves on opposite sides of the topic. Data is a scientific means for helping us to understand the topic.
